## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**naiaraschwalbert/naiaraschwalbert** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ I'm studying at Alura
- ğŸ’¬  I'm developing in the JavaScript language
- âš¡   I use this space to organize and share my projects developed.
